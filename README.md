# Leap Motion Button Game
A serial reaction time test program written in the Unity3D engine, utilizing the Leap Motion hand sensor.
This program was used as part of a study in motor learning in stroke patients which can be found [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8329689).

## Features
- The program tracks the user's relative hand and finger position while they perform a sequence of bottom presses and outputs them to a .csv file.

- The user can create their own tests with custom button sequences and delays.
